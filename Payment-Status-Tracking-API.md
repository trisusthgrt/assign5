## ‚è∞ **Automatic Overdue Detection**

The system includes an **automatic scheduled task** that runs daily at 9:00 AM to check for overdue payments:

### **How It Works:**
1. **Daily Schedule**: Runs every day at 9:00 AM automatically
2. **Detection Logic**: Checks all PENDING and PARTIAL payments for overdue status
3. **Automatic Update**: Marks payments as OVERDUE if past due date
4. **Audit Logging**: All automatic status changes are logged
5. **Days Calculation**: Automatically calculates and sets overdue days

### **What Gets Checked:**
- All payments with status `PENDING` or `PARTIAL`
- Payments with a `dueDate` set
- Payments where `dueDate` is before today's date

### **Automatic Actions:**
- Status changed from `PENDING`/`PARTIAL` to `OVERDUE`
- `overdueDays` field updated with calculated days
- `statusUpdatedAt` and `statusUpdatedBy` fields updated
- Complete audit log entry created

---

## üí° **Payment Status Workflow Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Normal Payment Lifecycle**

1. **Create Payment:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/payments
# Status: PENDING
```

2. **Mark as Paid:**
```bash
PUT /api/v1/payments/25/status
{
    "status": "PAID",
    "statusNotes": "Bank transfer confirmed"
}
```

3. **Final Status:** `PAID` (completed)

### **Scenario 2: Overdue Payment Management**

1. **Payment Created with Due Date:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/payments
# Status: PENDING, dueDate: 2025-08-01
```

2. **Automatic Detection:** (Daily at 9 AM)
```bash
# System automatically marks as OVERDUE after due date
# Status: OVERDUE, overdueDays: 15
```

3. **Manual Update:**
```bash
PUT /api/v1/payments/26/status
{
    "status": "PAID",
    "statusNotes": "Late payment received"
}
```

### **Scenario 3: Dispute Resolution Workflow**

1. **Dispute Payment:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/payments/27/dispute
{
    "disputeReason": "Service quality issues"
}
# Status: DISPUTED
```

2. **Resolve Dispute:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/payments/27/resolve-dispute?resolutionNotes=Service corrected, customer satisfied
# Status: PENDING
```

3. **Final Payment:**
